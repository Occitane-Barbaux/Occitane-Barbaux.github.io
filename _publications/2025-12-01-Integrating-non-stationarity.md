title: "Integrating non-stationarity and uncertainty in design life levels based on climatological time series"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-12-01-Integrating-non-stationarity
excerpt: 'This paper presents some of my thesis methodological developments, the combined predictive equivalent reliability, which aims to keep design-period exceedance risk identical to existing practice  in the context of non-stationary climate change, while including stochastic and estimation uncertainty. It is applied to Southern France annual maxima.'

This paper presents some of my thesis methodological developments, the combined predictive equivalent reliability, which aims to keep design-period exceedance risk identical to existing practice  in the context of non-stationary climate change, while including stochastic and estimation uncertainty. It is applied to Southern France annual maxima.
