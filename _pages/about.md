# Hello !
I'm a Ph.D Researcher in the French National Center for Meteorological Research ([CNRM](Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques )) in Toulouse, France since October 2022.
My research focuses on Extreme Value Theory, Bayesian Statistics and Climate Change.

My thesis aims to estimate Extreme Temperature on a local scale by 2100, with a statistical Bayesian framework using both climate models' data and local meteorological observations. This has possible applications in Nuclear safety risk assessments and Building codes.
