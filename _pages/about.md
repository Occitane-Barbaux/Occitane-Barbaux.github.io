## Hello !
I'm a Ph.D. researcher in Toulouse, France since October 2022. I work for the French National Center for Meteorological Research ([CNRM](https://www.umr-cnrm.fr/) ), the Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety ([IRSN](https://en.irsn.fr/)) and the Laboratory for Sciences of Climate and Environment ([LSCE](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/en/Phocea/Vie_des_labos/Ast/ast_service.php?id_unit=24)).

My research focuses on **Extreme Value Theory**,**Life-levels**, **Bayesian Statistics**, and **Climate Change**.

My thesis aims to **define the risk of extreme temperature levels excess by 2100 at a local scale**, with a statistical Bayesian framework using both climate models' data and local meteorological observations. This has possible **applications in Nuclear safety risk assessments** and Building codes.
