## Hello !
I'm a Ph.D Researcher in the French National Center for Meteorological Research ([CNRM](Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques )) in Toulouse, France since October 2022.

My research focuses on **Extreme Value Theory**,**Life-levels**, **Bayesian Statistics**, and **Climate Change**.

My thesis aims to **define the risk of extreme temperature levels excess by 2100 at a local scale**, with a statistical Bayesian framework using both climate models' data and local meteorological observations. This has possible **applications in Nuclear safety risk assessments** and Building codes.
